## Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use the `thayn.cc` URL shortener API.

### Information We Collect

When you use the `thayn.cc` URL shortener API, we collect and store the following information:

- Original URLs: The URLs you submit to the API for shortening.
- URL Aliases: The automatically generated aliases used to create the shortlinks.
- User API Key Name: The name of your user API key.
- IP Addresses: In order to prevent abuse of the API, we temporarily store IP addresses used during API interactions. These IP addresses are stored ephemerally in memory and are not shared with any third parties.

### Use of Google Safe Search API

When you visit a shortlink generated by the `thayn.cc` URL shortener API, we utilize the Google Safe Search API to ensure a safe browsing experience. Upon visiting a shortlink, the associated URL is scanned using the Google Safe Search API, and if a potential threat is detected, we display a warning message to alert you about the potential risk.

Please note that the scanning process occurs at the time of visiting the shortlink, rather than during the URL generation by the `thayn.cc` API. We do not send any personally identifiable information (PII) to Google during this process.

### Data Storage and Sharing

`thayn.cc` securely stores the following information in relation to the URL shortening service:

- Original URLs: The URLs you submit to the API for shortening.
- URL Aliases: The automatically generated aliases used to create the shortlinks.
- User API Key Name: The name of your user API key.

We do not store or share any additional data collected from you. Please note that we do not collect personalized analytics data or track individual user activities.

### Security

At `thayn.cc`, we prioritize the security of your personal information. We have implemented the following security measures:

- HTTPS: We enforce HTTPS (HTTP Secure) to ensure that all data transmitted between your browser and the `thayn.cc` URL shortener API is encrypted and protected.
- CORS: We utilize Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to restrict access to the `thayn.cc` API, allowing only authorized domains to interact with the service.
- Strict CSP: We implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and unauthorized code execution.
- Rate Limiting: We enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect the `thayn.cc` URL shortener API from excessive or malicious usage.

Please note that while we have implemented these security measures, no method of transmission or storage over the internet is completely secure. We continuously monitor and update our security practices to maintain a high level of protection for your data.

### Changes to this Privacy Notice

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any updates by posting the revised Privacy Notice on this page.
